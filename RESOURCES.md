## Project examples

[github/todometer-kmp](https://github.com/serbelga/Todometer-KMP/tree/main) - A completed OSS app
using KMP and
sqldelight - LARGE mutli module feel and a bit confusing right now

## KMP Tools

[KMP Compatibility Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-compatibility-guide.html)
[KMM plugin releases](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-plugin-releases.html#release-details)
[github/KMM-ViewModel](https://github.com/rickclephas/KMM-ViewModel) - need to see if this is useful
to have a single
view model for all platforms instead of building our own
[github/kmp-awesome](https://github.com/terrakok/kmp-awesome) A nice list of useful KMP tools

## iOS Stuff

[DuckDuckGo - How does KMP for ios work](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+does+kmp+for+ios+work&atb=v353-1&ia=web)

## Android Stuff

[developers.android/compose ui architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/architecture) -
Just a quick
reminder of UDF and such
[developers.android/domain and use cases](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/domain-layer?hl=en) -
we
should use this style I think and get used to it

## Dependency Injection

[medium/SQLDelight in KMP with Koin for DI](https://medium.com/arconsis/sqldelight-in-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-kmm-9ed8a539ec27) -
SQLDelight stuff is same as what is in their docs, but shows using koin to inject the db
[github/koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) - DI Library using DSL syntax
